## FEND Fitness App

This repository contains the frontend for a fictional fitness web app written in React with TypeScript and using styled-components for styling. It communicates with a REST API built with Node/Express.

The app provides the possibility to view, start and complete different programs, workouts and exercises. 
Currently, no user management or authentication is implemented. State changes like completing a program/workout or setting favorites are done globally on the programs/workouts themselves.

The app is hosted on Netlify [here](https://jolly-lewin-397b5d.netlify.app).

The design is not by me; the app follows [this design](https://www.figma.com/file/2YC8FSI19T9VJqCtOCyTRL/FEND-App?node-id=0%3A1) provided by opencampus.sh.
